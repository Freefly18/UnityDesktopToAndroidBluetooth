This is a dump of a tutorial made to show how one can communicate via bluetooth between a Windows Unity application and a Android Unity application, using a man-in-the-middle software.

As of now the tutorial itself is only in french, but the code itself is available and somewhat documented in english.

If you are only interested in the man-in-the-middle software, see \PC\BluetoothToTCP for the Visual Studio solution, including an .exe.

All code, unless noted otherwise, by Alexandre Millette: alex_millette@hotmail.com
